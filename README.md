# Job Listing Site

This website is for me to learn React.
If you host this site, It would not work since it doesn't use a Server for it's API, instead It uses JSON Server (jobs.json file)

Two scripts available for further development and production:

- npm run dev for Vite dev server
- npm run build for final production bundling
